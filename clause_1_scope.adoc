== Scope

This CDB Best Practice (BP) defines a RCS (Radar Cross-Section) model representation for use by Sensor Simulation client-devices such as Radar and/or Sonar. The BP provides a signature model representing the overall relative reflectivity levels of a given Model Representation when viewed at discrete azimuth and elevation angles. The RCS data is then used in range and aspect calculations for the detection and classification of simulated targets (either static or moving).
