==  RCS Data Model
=== Radar Cross Section Data Model

The Radar Cross-Section (RCS) of a target is a measure of the radar reflection characteristics of a target (usually expressed in m^2^, dBsm, or volts). It is equal to the power reflected back to the radar divided by power density of the wave striking the target. For most targets, the radar cross-section corresponds to the area of the cross section of the sphere that would reflect the same energy back to the radar, if a metal sphere were substituted. A sphere is sometimes used since the RCS of a sphere is independent of frequency if operating in the far field region of the radar. The following sections define the requirements for an RCS in a conformant CDB data store.

=== RCS Data Model

The CDB RCS data is organized so that client-devices can easily retrieve the following information from the RCS model (<<img_GraphicalRepresentationofthe3DModelRCSVectorData>>: Graphical Representation of the 3D Model RCS Vector Data) below:

* The modeling (physical) parameters that were used to generate the RCS polar data.
* The RCS polar representation corresponding to one or more levels of resolution of the RCS polar data.
* The RCS polar representation corresponding to distinct radar mode of operation.
* The RCS polar representation corresponding to a distinct radar model type.

RCS resolution refers to the angular pitch used in gathering RCS data for the model in question. At a given RCS resolution, it is possible to have two or more RCS polar representations due to the fact that the RCS data is computed based on a number of physical modeling properties such as the characteristics of the electromagnetic beam, its frequency, polarization, amplitude and phase. A simulated sensor operating in a given mode of operation, over a given range of frequencies, will require the RCS data closest to this mode. It will therefore need to use the closest matching Polar Diagram from the RCS model data.

=== RCS Polar Diagram Data Representation using Shapefile

This section provides a detailed description of the content and format of RCS data for a conformant implementation of a CDB data store.

==== Shapefile Internal Data Structure

include::requirements/REQ001.adoc[]

This section describes the vector data structure for the representation of RCS model data. This format provides the required flexibility to create and visualize the RCS data including:

* Easy modification of data attributes

* Simple visualization of RCS data in polar form
* Allow irregular steps in azimuth/elevation (X/Y)
* Allow some possibly missing values

RCS data is inherently two-dimensional in nature and is naturally organized as a two-dimensional array of RCS polar values computed at various azimuth and elevation angles from the target. Each element of this array represents the RCS data value over each uniformly distributed azimuth angle and distinct elevation angle.

Therefore, each of such array element can be represented as a “Point” geometry, with the azimuth angle value (X) at a given elevation angle (Y), while at the same time storing the associated attributes such as the RCS, Amplitude or Phase data in the instance attribute database (dbf file) associated to the vector data, currently a Shapefile. Typical azimuth angles would range between -180° and +180°, whereas the elevation angles would cover from -90° to +90°. However, the RCS data set could potentially only cover just a partial range of those angles if data is incomplete for example. This can be visualized in the next diagram, showing RCS values at various azimuth angles corresponding to an elevation angle of 20° with respect to the model (cube). Note that the axis conventions follow those described in Section 6.3, Coordinate Systems.

*Figure 7-1: Graphical Representation of the 3D Model RCS Vector Data*



Partial RCS data is permitted, i.e., it is permitted to cover a sub-region of the RCS polar diagram with only points corresponding to known values.

For example, consider an RCS model consisting of data values in 5^o^ elevation increments and 2^o^ azimuth increments covering the entire aspect angle range of the target. The CDB representation would consist of (180°/5°)+1 = 37 sets of (360°/2°)+1 = 181 points (vertices) for a full target aspect coverage; yielding 6697 point shapes with their attribute data.

Such a data representation would typically produce the following diagram when viewed in 2D (<<img_PolarDiagramofRCSDatainPlanarRepresentation>>: Polar Diagram of RCS Data in Planar Representation) and 3D (<<img_PolarDiagramofRCSDatainSphericalRepresentation>>: Polar Diagram of RCS Data in Spherical Representation) polar forms (color representing the RCS Intensity attribute):

In addition, specific attributes within the vector data are required to specify other characteristics of the RCS data, like EM polarization mode and frequency that were used when characterizing the target’s RCS signature. Those are the class-level attributes and are described below.


include::requirements/REQ004.adoc[]


1.  RCS Model Class-level attribution: These are attributes that can be shared by all of the RCS model instances of the RCS representation. The attributes and their values are logically re-grouped under a classname that stands for the entire attributes specific to the RCS model. All of the classnames are re-grouped into a model.dbf file referred to as the RCS Class Attribute file for the RCS model. (See Section 7.4.1, Directory Structure) Each row of the model.dbf file corresponds to a different classname. The first column of the file is the classname attribute and acts as the primary key to access subsequent table entries; all other columns correspond to the attributes represented by the classname.
2.  RCS Instance-level attribution: This is the data that represents a particular instance of the RCS model for a RCS representation. The data is contained in the attribution columns of the model.dbf file that accompanies the RCS’s *.shp file. This *.dbf file is referred to as the RCS Instance Attribute file of the RCS model. (See Section 7.4.1, Directory Structure) The first column of each row is always the classname attribute. The other columns in a RCS Instance Attribute file are used to describe further the associated shape.

[[RCSModelClassLevelAttributes]]
===== RCS Model Class-Level Attributes

Many attributes within the vector data are required to specify the physical modeling parameters corresponding to those used to produce the RCS data. These include, for instance, the electromagnetic (EM) polarization mode and the frequency that were used when characterizing the target’s RCS signature.

The CDB RCS model representation offers a comprehensive set of class attributes that are described below. Please note that these attributes are an elaborate set of fields to indicate in which physical environment the RCS data were computed and does not necessarily reflect a precise operating mode of a particular radar.

A description of the attribute information follows below. (The reader should keep in mind that the 10-character limitation of attribute names is imposed by the dBASE III+ file format used by the Shapefile .DBF data format).

===== RCS Instance-Level Attribute Data

The data for an entire RCS model itself is stored as a series of Point geometries, each representing the RCS data values with respect to the model’s center for the corresponding azimuth and elevation angles as represented by the point X and Y coordinates. The *.dbf portion of the vector data set provides the instance attribute information for each of the RCS Point. A description of the attribute information follows below:

*ShapeType* = POINT

Values:

X coordinate is the Azimuth angle of the RCS sample

Y coordinate is the Elevation angle of the RCS sample

NOTE:The RCS of the model when viewed at +90° elevation (top view) is significantly different than the one at -90° elevation (bottom view), so there should be (180/EL_STEP)+1 point values to cover all elevations. The azimuth, which has the same RCS value for +180° and -180° will cover (360/AZ_STEP) point values.

For a given RCS curve in a vector data set, an attribute “CLASSNAME” indicates which type of sensor application the curve data is derived for, and under which resolution the data was produced. Therefore, the single vector data set of the Model can regroup all sensor data pertaining to various RCS signature types and resolutions for a given RCS Model. Consider the next example. The vector data format therefore should not preclude the capability to support multiple RCS curves simultaneously for a given model.

==== Model’s Articulations Effect on RCS Data

Most man-made models (aircraft, tanks, trucks, etc.) have parts that can be articulated (flaps, turrets, rotating antennae, landing gears, etc). It is impractical to pre-compute and store within the CDB an RCS model for every possible position of those articulated parts taken individually. Instead, a CDB RCS model attribute provides the means to store an overall RCS variation effect, or otherwise called “scintillation effect”. The scintillation effect value is added to the RCS at run-time during movement of any of such articulated parts of the model. This is a parameter in the vector data attributes called “RCS_SCINT” and this attribute can be used by the radar client-devices at runtime to provide a correlated (but approximated) variation level of the model RCS while any of its parts are articulated.

For example, for a tank in the process of rotating its turret, the radar simulation client would take its overall RCS (based on aspect angles) and add the scintillation factor on the end-result RCS value to slightly alter the RCS to introduce the turning turret effect while the part is moving. While this adds an approximation factor on the RCS, it provides a coherent and correlated variation level to all clients using the RCS data set layer. The “RCS_SCINT” is therefore the value that represents a scaling factor of RCS noise that would be superimposed while the part is being articulated.
