Each variant of the RCS model in the vector data set SHALL have a 10-character string attribute called “RCS_VARI”. The string may contain the specific Radar model number (and possibly its frequency band L-Band, S-Band, X-Band, Ku-Band) for which this RCS variant applies to. The suggested string convention for this field is as described in reference <<R22>>. {set:cellbgcolor:#FFFFFF}
